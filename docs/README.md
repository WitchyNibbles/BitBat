# BitBat Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the BitBat project. This folder contains markdown guides that explain:

- The high-level system overview and architecture.
- The source code structure and contracts between modules.
- How to set up the environment and run common workflows such as data ingestion, feature generation, model training, inference, batch operations, and monitoring.

Navigate using the links below:

- [Documentation Hub (this page)](./README.md)
- [System Overview](./system-overview.md)
- [Project Structure](./project-structure.md)
- [Usage Guide](./usage-guide.md)
- [Testing & Quality](./testing-quality.md)
- [Data Contracts](./data-contracts.md)

If you are new to the codebase, start with the system overview and work your way through the structure and usage guides. The data contracts page documents the schema guarantees enforced throughout the pipeline, while the testing page summarizes guardrails that protect against leakage or regression.
